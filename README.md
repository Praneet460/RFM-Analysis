# RFM-Analysis
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis is a marketing technique used to determine quantitatively which customers are the best ones by examining how recently a customer has purchased (Recency), how often they purchase (Frequency), and how much the customer spends (Monetary).

<b>Recency(R):</b> Customers who purchased more recently are more likely to purchase again than are customers who purchased further in the past.<br/>
<b>Frequency(F):</b> Customers who have made more purchases in the past are more likely to respond than who have made fewer purchases.<br/>
<b>Monetary:</b> Customers who have spent more (in total for all purchases) in the past are more likely to respond than those who have spent less.

## Benefits of RFM Analysis

* Increased customer Retention
* Increased response rate
* Increased Conversion Rate
* Increased Revenue

## Table with key RFM Segments

| Segment | RFM | Description | Marketing |
|:--------|:---:|:------------|:---------:|
|<b>Best Customers</b>| 111 | Customers who brought most recently, most often and spend the most | No price incentives, New products and loyalty programs |
|<b>Loyal Customers</b>| X1X | Customers who bought most recently | Use R and M to further segment |
|<b>Big Spenders</b>| XX1 | Customers who spend the most | Market your most expensive products |
|<b>Almost Lost</b>| 311 | Haven't purchased for some time, but purchased frequently and spend the most | Agressive price incentives |
|<b>Lost Customers</b>| 411 |Haven't purchased for some time, but purchased frequently and spend the most | Agressive price incentives |
|<b>Lost Cheap Customers</b>| 444 | Last purchase long ago, purchased few and spend little | Don't spend too much trying to re-acquire |

## Interpreting the RFM  Analysis

Let us suppose we receive the below result

| Customer | Recency(R) | Frequency(F) | Monetary Value(M) | RFM Class |
|:---------|:----------:|:------------:|:-----------------:|:---------:|
|Etha K.|4 days|58 orders|$2869|1-1-1|
|Jerold Sporer|50 days|1 order|$44|3-4-4|
|Anie Hettinger|47 days|2 orders|$156|3-2-1|

<b>Result:</b><br/>
1. <b>Etha K.</b> belongs to the "<b>Best Customer</b>" segment --<br/>
She purchased recently (R=1), frequently buys (F=1), and spent the most (M=1).
2. <b>Jerold Sporer</b> is about to enter the "<b>Lost Cheap Customer</b>" segment --<br/>
He has not purchased in a while (R=3), bought few (F=4), and spent little (M=4).
3. <b>Anie Hettinger</b> is a type of "<b>Almost Lost Customer</b>" segment --<br/>
She has not made a purchase for some time (R=3), she bought somewhat frequently (F=2), but she is in the group who spent the most (M=1).
